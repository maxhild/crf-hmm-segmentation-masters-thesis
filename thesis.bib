This paper presents a study which examined the visibility of health and medical information websites. The purpose of this study was to find out why Google is decreasing the visibility of such websites and how to measure this decrease. Since August 2018, Google has been more rigorously rating these websites, since they can potentially impact people’s health. The method of the study was to collect data about the visibility of health and medical information websites in sequential time snapshots. Visibility consists of combined data of unique keywords, positions, and {URL} results. The sample under study was made up of 21 websites selected from 10 European countries. The findings reveal that in sequential time snapshots, search visibility decreased. The decrease was not dependent on the country or the language. The main reason why Google is decreasing the visibility of such websites is that they do not meet high ranking criteria.},

	abstract = {Search Engines ({SEs}) have become the most significant tool for retrieving information from the World Wide Web ({WWW}) against user-generated queries. Presently, the data available on the Internet is growing exponentially in three different dimensions i.e. size, processing power, \& software intelligence. The {WWW} has evolved from being a collection of static content (web 1.0) to an intelligent web (Web 3.0). To reach a large audience on the internet, it is now essential for every business to have a website. However, to reach more viewers, a website must be visible on top of the Search Engine Result Page ({SERP}) because {SERP} top-ranking ultimately gives benefits in terms of more web traffic and helps to generate more revenues. This paper introduces the important concepts of Search Engine Optimization ({SEO}) and provides numerous guidelines for website developers to enhance the visibility of their websites in the eyes of search engines. We concluded our paper by proposing key factors and introducing a {SERP} equation to predict business website ranking.},

	abstract = {The visibility of academic articles or conference papers depends on their being easily found in academic search engines, above all in Google Scholar. To enhance this visibility, search engine optimization ({SEO}) has been applied in recent years to academic search engines in order to optimize documents and, thereby, ensure they are better ranked in search pages (i.e., academic search engine optimization or {ASEO}). To achieve this degree of optimization, we ﬁrst need to further our understanding of Google Scholar’s relevance ranking algorithm, so that, based on this knowledge, we can highlight or improve those characteristics that academic documents already present and which are taken into account by the algorithm. This study seeks to advance our knowledge in this line of research by determining whether the language in which a document is published is a positioning factor in the Google Scholar relevance ranking algorithm. Here, we employ a reverse engineering research methodology based on a statistical analysis that uses Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient. The results obtained point to a bias in multilingual searches conducted in Google Scholar with documents published in languages other than in English being systematically relegated to positions that make them virtually invisible. This ﬁnding has important repercussions, both for conducting searches and for optimizing positioning in Google Scholar, being especially critical for articles on subjects that are expressed in the same way in English and other languages, the case, for example, of trademarks, chemical compounds, industrial products, acronyms, drugs, diseases, etc.},

The present article argues that dialogism transcends the distinction between interactionist and constructionist social theories of written communication, as presented by Nystrand and colleagues. The theoretical argument is illustrated by a study of one writer who is struggling to learn argumentative writing. In analyzing this writer’s development, the focus is on grounding, specifically, the interplay between foregrounded and backgrounded parts of discourse. The results illustrate that appropriation of conventional resources for grounding is more creative and dyadically contextualized than constructionist theories may invite us to think. Simultaneously, appropriation draws on conventional communicative resources in ways that are hard to explain within interactionist theories. A dialogical model is presented to show that the Bakhtinian “double dialogue” of discourse meets in the “diatope”—that multidimensional (ecological) point of co-constitution where interaction and construction merge into one unified perspective.},

It bridges the key {AI} fields of computer vision and natural language processing in conjunction with real-time and practical applications. Deep learning-based approaches employed for video description have demonstrated enhanced results compared to conventional approaches. The current literature lacks a thorough interpretation of the recently developed and employed sequence to sequence techniques for video description. This paper fills that gap by focusing mainly on deep learning-enabled approaches to automatic caption generation. Sequence to sequence models follow an Encoder–Decoder architecture employing a specific composition of {CNN}, {RNN}, or the variants {LSTM} or {GRU} as an encoder and decoder block. This standard-architecture can be fused with an attention mechanism to focus on a specific distinctiveness, achieving high quality results. Reinforcement learning employed within the Encoder–Decoder structure can progressively deliver state-of-the-art captions by following exploration and exploitation strategies. The transformer mechanism is a modern and efficient transductive architecture for robust output. Free from recurrence, and solely based on self-attention, it allows parallelization along with training on a massive amount of data. It can fully utilize the available {GPUs} for most {NLP} tasks. Recently, with the emergence of several versions of transformers, long term dependency handling is not an issue anymore for researchers engaged in video processing for summarization and description, or for autonomous-vehicle, surveillance, and instructional purposes. They can get auspicious directions from this research.},

  1 Rate of adequate bowel preparation (minimum standard 90 \%); 2 Cecal intubation rate (minimum standard 90 \%); 3 Adenoma detection rate (minimum standard 25 \%); 4 Appropriate polypectomy technique (minimum standard 80 \%); 5 Complication rate (minimum standard not set); 6 Patient experience (minimum standard not set); 7 Appropriate post-polypectomy surveillance recommendations (minimum standard not set). 

 Other identified performance measures have been listed as less relevant based on an assessment of their importance, scientific acceptability, feasibility, usability, and comparison to competing measures.},

    abstract = { Background: Studies have identified characteristics of adenomas detected on colonoscopy to be predictive of adenoma recurrence. Objective: To assess the role of both colonoscopy-related factors and polyp characteristics on the risk for colorectal cancer after colonoscopic polyp detection. Design: Population-based case–control study (3148 case participants and 3274 control participants). Setting: Rhine-Neckar region of Germany. Patients: Case and control participants with physician-validated detection of polyps (other than hyperplastic polyps) at a previous colonoscopy in the past 10 years. Measurements: Detailed history and results of previous colonoscopies were obtained through interviews and medical records. Case and control participants were compared according to colonoscopy-related factors (incompleteness, poor bowel preparation, incomplete removal of all polyps, and no surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years) and polyp characteristics (≥1 cm, villous components or high-grade dysplasia, ≥3 polyps, and ≥1 proximal polyp). Odds ratios (ORs) and attributable fractions were derived by using multiple logistic regression and the Levin formula. Results: 155 case participants and 260 control participants with physician-validated polyp detection in the past 10 years were identified. The following characteristics were significantly more common among case participants than among control participants: not all polyps completely removed (29.0\% vs. 9.6\%; OR, 3.73 [95\% CI, 2.11 to 6.60]), no surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years (26.5\% vs. 11.5\%; OR, 2.96 [CI, 1.70 to 5.16]), and detection of 3 or more polyps (14.2\% vs. 7.3\%; OR, 2.21 [CI, 1.07 to 4.54]). Odds ratios ranged from 1.12 to 1.42 and CIs included 1.00 for all other variables. Overall, 41.1\% and 21.7\% of cancer cases were statistically attributable to colonoscopy-related factors and polyp characteristics, respectively. Limitation: This was an observational study with potential for residual confounding and selection bias. Conclusion: Colonoscopy-related factors are more important than polyp characteristics for stratification of colorectal cancer risk after colonoscopic polyp detection in the community setting.
